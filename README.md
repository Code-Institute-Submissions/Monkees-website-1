WELCOME! 

It's a project made for a Code Institute course about a music band of The Monkees.

I've used bootstrap, html and css with font awesome on this project

First i've made a main page with few sections navigation and footer;
the section are short versions of they full pages which You can get to by choosing them from navigation or links in titles of each section.

The page was check at html validator, css validator, and all main functions like transitions were checked manually
while media queries were check at google chrome programistic tools.
